# CustomBIP39Entropy
Generation of customized BIP39 recovery phrases for cryptowallets and analysis of loss of entropy

This is currently not a CL tool, and there is no config file. You can edit the number of words in the recovery phrase, the number n of different passphrases generated, and the customization phrase/string in the crypt.py file. The resulting recovery phrases are written to gen_file.txt (non-appending).
